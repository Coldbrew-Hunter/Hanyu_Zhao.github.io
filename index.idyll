## Introduction of Data

The data I'm using for this assignment is
[a href:"https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/AER/CigarettesB.csv"] Cigarettes Consumption Data[/a].
The dataset collects cigarettes consumption information regarding the number of selling packs,
the price of each pack of cigarette, and the income of selling the cigarettes. The data give a general view of
the consumption of cigarettes in each state, which will help people better learn the cigarettes market.


## Data at a glance

## Cigarettes Consumption Data Visualization

I made the bar chart data visualization based on the price of the cigarette and
the number of the sold packs, so that through the visualization people can see the
impact of price on the number of sold packs. (Maybe the corelation between the two
data isn't that strong).

[IdyllVegaLite data:Cigarettes_Consumption_Data spec:`{
  mark: "bar",
  height: "500",
  width: "300",
  encoding: {
    x: {
      bin: true,
      field: "price",
      type: "ordinal",
      axis: {title: "Total Income"},
    },
    y: {
      field: "income",
      type: "ordinal",
      axis: {title: "Sold Packs"},
    }
  }
}` /]

I used the bar chart vega-lite to do this data visualization.
The reason why I choose this vega-lite
is because it somehow could reflect the distribution of the number of sold packs
and its falling total income domain. If I could have more time,
I will further make the data more clear and let eveything on the chart make sense.
